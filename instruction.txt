Build instruction:
Clone the repo recursively
Open the solution in Loader directory.
You may need to adjust the proper include folder for release mode.

Install insruction:
1. Copy from output binaries into your warhammer2.exe directory.
   - Loader.exe
   - min_hook.dll (this will be changed soon in the next iteration)
   - PDBs for the .exe and .dll, this will be required if you want to attach debugger when the game runs.

2. Make sure in warhammer2.exe directory, you have the following files:
    - steam_api64.dll
    - steam_appid.txt (contains a single line that is Warhammer 2 steamapp id: 594570)
   You can find both files in launcher directory. Otherwise the game won't launch and you get shitty electron launcher instead.

These 2 steps will be automated (and idiot proof) in the future.

Modders and devs:

In lua script, to use Warhammer 2 SNED lua loader, use `require2(moduleName, luaEntryPoint)` where moduleName is your DLL filename (without .dll extension, and located in warhammer2.exe directory, can be placed in subdirectory) and luaEntryPoint is your lua entry point procedure (such as luaopen_libsneedio), example: require2("libsneedio", "luaopen_libsneedio");

In the future we will make require2 function works seamlessly with the original `require` function like it used to.

You can pass parameters in the Loader.exe and it will be passed to the game executeable. I recommend creating a simple batch file like this to launch your game. In fact this is how I run my game 99% of the time. I only use the launcher once or twice when I need to disable or change the mods order.

my_epic_mods.bat
```
@echo off
set MOD=used_mods.txt

echo launching %MOD%
if not exist %MOD% goto :fail
Loader.exe %MOD%; -dx11
echo exiting...
if %ERRORLEVEL% GEQ 1 goto :fail
exit
:fail
echo Fail to launch game
pause
exit

```

Compatibility with 3rd party launcher:
Maybe? I never used 3rd party launcher in my life. I despise launcher.
